  <p>Born in <a href="https://traveltips.usatoday.com/hotels-near-pocantico-hills-new-york-39331.html" target="_blank">New York</a> state, I was raised in a tiny community and spent most of my free time on my grandparent's farm. My teenage years were
    spent in <a href="https://www.tucsonaz.gov/" target="_blank">Tucson, AZ</a>, and filled with days by the pool, competition cheerleading, and spending time with my
    brother. Young adulthood was spent in the southern state of Georgia. I graduated <a href="https://www.effinghamschools.com/echs" target="_blank">high school</a>, attended state <a href="https://www.uga.edu/" target="_blank">university</a>, and
    lived on my own for the first time. I now call Seattle, WA home. I love adventure and travel in my freetime, but can find
    me in front of my computer or TV on weeknights. <a href="https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/" target="_blank">Coffee</a>, <a href="https://michters.com/" target="_blank">whiskey</a>, movie, <a href="https://www.purebarre.com/"
